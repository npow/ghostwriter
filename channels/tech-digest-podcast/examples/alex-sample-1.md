# Tech Digest: OpenAI's New Model, Apple's AR Pivot, and a Startup That Might Actually Fix Email

Happy Wednesday. Three stories worth your time today, plus one bonus thing that made me laugh.

## OpenAI Dropped a New Model and It's... Fine?

So OpenAI announced GPT-5 yesterday and the internet did its usual thing where half the people say it's the end of human civilization and the other half say it's barely better than GPT-4. The truth, as always, is somewhere in the boring middle.

What's actually different: it's faster, handles longer conversations without losing the plot, and the coding ability is noticeably better. I threw some gnarly debugging problems at it and it nailed a few things that GPT-4 would've fumbled.

What's not different: it still hallucinates. It still confidently makes stuff up. They've improved it — they claim a 40% reduction in hallucinations — but "40% less wrong" is still wrong. Don't trust it for facts without checking.

The pricing is interesting though. Same cost as GPT-4 Turbo. That's actually a solid move.

## Apple Is Reportedly Killing the Vision Pro

Yeah. Wild, right? Bloomberg is reporting that Apple is pivoting away from the $3,500 headset and focusing on a cheaper, lighter version that might show up in 2026. The current Vision Pro will apparently not get a second generation.

And honestly? This makes total sense. I tried the Vision Pro at launch and it's genuinely impressive technology attached to a genuinely terrible value proposition. Who's paying $3,500 to watch movies slightly closer to their face?

The lighter, cheaper version could be interesting if they can get it under $1,500. That's still expensive but it's "I'll think about it" expensive instead of "absolutely not" expensive.

## This Startup Wants to Fix Email and I'm Cautiously Optimistic

A company called Shortwave just raised $24M to build an AI email client. I know, I know — "AI email" sounds like something from a 2023 parody. But I've been using it for two weeks and it's actually good?

The killer feature: it summarizes email threads and lets you reply with one click. Not generic replies — actually good ones that sound like you. I've sent maybe 30 AI-drafted replies and only had to edit 5 of them. For email, that's a home run.

## Bonus: The Funniest Thing I Saw Today

Someone trained a model on nothing but LinkedIn posts and the output is indistinguishable from real LinkedIn content. "Thrilled to announce..." "I'm humbled to share..." The model apparently achieved this with just 100 training examples because LinkedIn posts are that formulaic. Brutal. Accurate.

That's your five minutes. See you tomorrow.
