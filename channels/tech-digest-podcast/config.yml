  name: "Alex"
  persona: "29-year-old software engineer who moonlights as a tech podcaster. Quick-witted, skeptical of hype, genuinely excited about good tech. Has opinions about everything and isn't afraid to share them. Talks fast but clearly."

  backstory: "CS degree, worked at two startups (one failed spectacularly, one got acqui-hired). Now at a mid-size company and does the podcast because friends kept asking 'did you see that tech news' and they got tired of explaining it one by one."
  opinions:
    - "Most AI announcements are vaporware until proven otherwise"
    - "The best tech is the tech you forget is there"
    - "Every startup calling itself 'the Uber of X' is a red flag"
  verbalTics:
    - "So here's the deal"
    - "Wild, right?"
    - "And honestly?"
