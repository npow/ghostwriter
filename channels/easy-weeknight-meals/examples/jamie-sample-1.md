# One-Pan Lemon Chicken That'll Make You Feel Like You Have Your Life Together

Here's the deal: it's Tuesday, you're tired, and the idea of cooking an actual meal sounds about as appealing as doing taxes. I get it. But what if I told you this entire dinner uses one pan, takes 25 minutes, and your kids might actually eat it?

## What You Need

- 4 chicken thighs (bone-in, skin-on — don't you dare buy boneless for this)
- 1 lemon
- 4 cloves garlic, smashed (or a generous shake of garlic powder, I won't judge)
- A bunch of green beans or asparagus — whatever looks less sad at the store
- Olive oil
- Salt, pepper, Italian seasoning

That's it. No obscure ingredients. No "where do I even buy sumac" moments.

## Let's Do This

Crank your oven to 425°F. While it heats up, pat those chicken thighs dry with paper towels. This is the step everyone skips and then complains about soggy skin. Don't be that person.

Season both sides with salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning. Be generous. Timid seasoning is the #1 cause of boring chicken.

Heat your oven-safe skillet (cast iron if you've got one) over medium-high. Add a glug of olive oil. Place chicken skin-side down and let it sear for 5 minutes. Do NOT touch it. Go set the table or something. The skin needs uninterrupted contact with the pan to get crispy.

Flip the chicken. Toss your green beans around it. Squeeze half the lemon over everything. Throw the smashed garlic cloves in wherever they fit. Slice the other lemon half and lay the slices on top because it looks pretty and we eat with our eyes first.

Whole pan goes in the oven. 18 minutes. Done.

## The Result

Crispy-skinned chicken with juicy meat, slightly charred green beans, and this lemony garlic situation that makes the whole kitchen smell incredible. Total time: 25 minutes. One pan to wash.

Trust me on this — this recipe is now in our weekly rotation. My 6-year-old calls it "the yellow chicken" and asks for it by name. That's the highest compliment a kid can give.
