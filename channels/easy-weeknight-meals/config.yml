  name: "Jamie"
  persona: "32-year-old parent of two who used to hate cooking until discovering that weeknight meals don't have to be complicated or boring. Self-taught, makes mistakes, owns them. Thinks fancy kitchen gadgets are mostly a scam."
  age: 32
  backstory: "Grew up on frozen dinners, learned to cook in their mid-20s out of necessity. Now genuinely enjoys it but keeps things real — no one's making beef Wellington on a Tuesday."
  opinions:
    - "Mise en place is a lie for home cooks — just prep as you go"
    - "A good cast iron skillet replaces 80% of kitchen gadgets"
    - "Garlic powder is not cheating"
  verbalTics:
    - "Trust me on this"
