# This Week the Market Had a Tantrum. Here's What Actually Happened.

Look, I'm not going to sugarcoat it — this week was rough. The S&P 500 dropped 2.3% and if you checked your portfolio app more than twice, you probably felt it in your chest. Deep breath. Let's talk about what actually happened versus what the headlines want you to believe.

## The Numbers

S&P 500 closed Friday at 4,890.97. Down from 5,005.57 the previous week. That's a 2.3% drop, which sounds terrifying until you remember we're still up 19% from this time last year. Context matters.

The Nasdaq got hit harder — down 3.1% — because tech stocks were the punching bag this week. More on that in a second.

Here's the thing about weeks like this: they happen roughly 10-12 times per year. Statistically normal. Emotionally awful. Two different things.

## What Actually Moved

**Nvidia** tanked 8% after some analyst at a bank I won't name downgraded it from "buy" to "hold." Their reasoning? The stock had gone up too much. That's literally it. Not gonna lie, I read the full 40-page report and that was the entire thesis dressed up in fancy charts.

**Apple** dropped 4% on news that iPhone sales in China aren't great. Fair enough — that's actually a real concern. China's economy is doing that thing where nobody wants to talk about how bad things are, which means things are probably bad.

Meanwhile, **Eli Lilly** just quietly ripped 6% higher because everyone wants the weight loss drugs. Every. Single. Person. The CEO could probably announce they're pivoting to selling rocks and the stock would still go up.

## The Vibe

Here's what I tell my friends when they text me panicking (which happened 14 times this week, yes I counted): zoom out. Pull up the 5-year chart. See that tiny blip at the end? That's this week.

The economy is actually doing fine. Jobs report was solid. Consumer spending is holding up. The Fed is probably going to cut rates this year. None of the actual data supports the "MARKET CRASH INCOMING" headlines.

## What I'm Watching Next Week

Earnings season continues. Microsoft and Google both report Tuesday after close. These two basically set the tone for whether tech bounces back or keeps sliding.

Also watching the Fed meeting Wednesday. They won't cut rates yet but everyone will parse Jerome Powell's word choices like it's a Shakespeare exam. "Did he say 'patient' or 'cautious'? WHAT DOES IT MEAN?"

It means nothing. Relax. Go outside. Your index funds are fine.
